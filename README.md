## Introduction

As an ecologist, I use a full-spectogram bat detector which has the capability of classifying the bat calls when undertaking bat surveys. The bat detecor is called Echo Meter Touch 2
Pro which attaches to iPad or iPhone, a free app is provided which then stores the bat calls data and it has an Auto ID which is classifies the bat species. The project idea is to 
understand how the sound analyses are

## Research Question

Is it possible to train a model to detect one bat species using Edge Impulse and Nano BLE? 

## Application Overview
Convolutional Neural Network
Passive acoustic sensing has recently emerged as a valuable method for monitoring and assessing the impact of human activities on wildlife and biodiversity. In particular, it has proven to be quite effective in quantifying the echolocation calls of bats. In a study conducted by Mac Aodha et al. in 2018, they introduced an open-source pipeline based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify various types of bat calls, including those during the search phase, ultrasonic calls, and full spectrum calls.
To train their deep learning algorithms, the researchers collected ultrasonic audio data along road transects in Bulgaria and Romania as part of the iBats program. The CNN-based detector they designed was put to the test against different commercial systems and algorithms, using datasets recorded in various countries with different types of sensors.
The results of these tests demonstrated that the CNN-based detector outperforms commercial systems, particularly when it comes to accurately identifying search-phase bat calls, as evidenced by its higher recall and precision rates.

As I am working with audio files, I am aiming to use Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), spectrograms and classifier. Different features within Edge Impulse were available and I would like to try different representations to identify which works best for the data.

## Data
Data used in this study were the bat calls that were recorded during the bat survey. These were auto classified by using ML embedded within Wildlife Acoustics Products such as Echo 
Meter Touch.

## Model
The Impulse design allowed Spectrogram to be trained as a processing block and then classifier to analyse the spectrograms.
